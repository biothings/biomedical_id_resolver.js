# biomedical_id_resolver.js
js library for resolving biological ids to their equivalent ids in batch

## Install

```
$ npm i biomedical_id_resolver
```

## Usage

```js
const resolve = require('biomedical_id_resolver');

// input should be an object, with semantic type as the key, and array of CURIEs as value
let input = {
    "Gene": ["NCBIGene:1017", "NCBIGene:1018", "HGNC:1177"],
    "SmallMolecule": ["CHEBI:15377"],
    "Disease": ["MONDO:0004976"],
    "Cell": ["CL:0002372"]
  };

(async () => {
  const resolver = new resolve();
	console.log(await resolver.resolve(input);
	//=> {'NCBIGene:1017': {...}, 'NCBIGene:1018': {...}, 'HGNC:1177': {...}, 'CHEBI:15377': {...}, 'MONDO:0004976': {...}, 'CL:0002372': {...}}
})();

```

## Output Schema

- Output is a javascript Object

- The root keys are CURIES (e.g. NCBIGene:1017) which are passed in as input

- The values represents resolved identifiers

- Each CURIE will have 4 required fields

  - id: the primary id (selected based on the ranking described in the next section) and label

  - curies: an array, each element represents a resolved id in CURIE format

  - type: the semantic type of the identifier

  - db_ids: original ids from source database, could be curies or non-curies.


- if an ID can not be resolved using the package, it will have an additional field called "flag", with value equal to "failed"

- Example Output

```json
{
  "NCBIGene:1017": {
    "id": {
      "label": "cyclin dependent kinase 2",
      "identifier": "NCBIGene:1017"
    },
    "db_ids": {
      "NCBIGene": [
        "1017"
      ],
      "ENSEMBL": [
        "ENSG00000123374"
      ],
      "HGNC": [
        "1771"
      ],
      "SYMBOL": [
        "CDK2"
      ],
      "UMLS": [
        "C1332733",
        "C0108855"
      ],
      "name": [
        "cyclin dependent kinase 2"
      ]
    },
    "type": "Gene",
    "curies": [
      "NCBIGene:1017",
      "ENSEMBL:ENSG00000123374",
      "HGNC:1771",
      "SYMBOL:CDK2",
      "UMLS:C1332733",
      "UMLS:C0108855"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Query Using [SRI node normalizer](https://nodenormalization-sri-dev.renci.org/1.1/docs#/)
### Usage
```js
const resolver = require('biomedical_id_resolver');

// input must be an object, with semantic type as the key, and array of CURIEs as value

let input = {
    "Gene": ["NCBIGene:1017", "NCBIGene:1018", "HGNC:1177"],
    "SmallMolecule": ["CHEBI:15377"],
    "Disease": ["MONDO:0004976"],
    "Cell": ["CL:0002372"]
};

// SRI resolver will figure out the semantic type if the input type is 'unknown', 'undefined', or 'NamedThing'
let input = {
    "unknown": ["NCBIGene:1017", "MONDO:0004976"],
};

(async () => {
  let res = await resolver.resolveSRI(input);
  console.log(res);
})();
```

### Example Output
The output contains `id` and `equivalent_identifiers` straight from SRI as well as the same fields as the base resolver to make it backwards compatible with it. If the SRI resolved semantic type doesn't agree with the input semantic type, there will be 2 entries in the array for the curie.
```json
{
  "NCBIGene:1017": [
    {
      "id": {
        "identifier": "NCBIGene:1017",
        "label": "CDK2"
      },
      "equivalent_identifiers": [
        {
          "identifier": "NCBIGene:1017",
